!!! info "Things you should know"
    * Version 2.0 is completely backwards compatible with App Connect 1.6.x. If you experience a problem and wish to revert, you can do so safely without loss of data. 
	* We will continue to maintain App Connect 1.6.x, but only with bug fixes.

## Future costs

We are committed to providing App Connect for free so that users can take advantage of its core functionality to connect RingCentral to popular CRMs. These features include:

* Contact lookups and matching
* Call-pop or "Screen-pop"
* Client-side call logging, both automated and manual

!!! money "Some third-party adapters may come at an additional cost"
    App Connect is able to connect RingCentral to so many CRMs thanks to our developer community. Some developers have chosen to charge a fee to use their adapter to help fund their support and maintenance costs. RingCentral customers must establish an independent billing relationship with App Connect connector providers.
