# Data sharing between App Connect and connected CRMs

This document outlines the types of data that are exchanged between App Connect and your connected Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Understanding this data exchange is crucial for managing compliance, privacy, and security within your organization.

## Our Data Privacy Philosophy

We are committed to a principle of **data minimization**. We strive to store only the absolute minimum information required to operate and maintain the App Connect product effectively.

* **Anonymization:** RingCentral user extension IDs are anonymized within our platform.
* **Identifiers:** For reporting, platform operation, and support purposes, we do store **RingCentral account IDs** and **CRM account IDs**.

## Data Shared from App Connect to a Connected CRM

App Connect's primary function is to log communications that take place on the RingCentral platform (e.g., calls, SMS, faxes) as activities within the customer's connected CRM. The data shared from RingCentral to the CRM via App Connect can include (and is subject to user preferences):

### Communication Metadata

This includes all relevant metadata for the communication event:

* **Sender and Receiver Information:** This may contain **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, such as the phone number or name of the parties involved.
* **Telephony Session Identifiers:** Internal session IDs used by RingCentral.
* **Reporting Data:** Everything necessary to accurately report on the communication event, including:
    * Who made/received the communication.
    * The date and time of the event.
    * The duration of the call.

### Media and Artifacts

* **File Links:** Direct links to files such as call recordings and faxes.
* **Temporary Download Links:** Short-lived links for downloading files. Note that these links may encode a short-lived authentication token for secure access.
* **Transcripts:** The transcript of the phone call.
* **AI-Generated Artifacts (from ACE product):** Additional insights or data points generated by our internal AI engine.

## Data Accessed and Stored by App Connect from the CRM

App Connect must access and, in some cases, temporarily store data from the connected CRM to facilitate logging, performance optimization, and integration functionality.

### Core Identifiers and Preferences

* **Account and User Identifiers:**
    * RingCentral account ID, CRM account ID.
    * User IDs and extension IDs.
* **Preferences:** User and account configuration settings and preferences.

### CRM Contact Information

To accurately associate communication events with existing CRM records, App Connect accesses:

* **Contact Details:** Phone numbers, names, and IDs of contacts stored within the CRM.
* **Activity/Note Identifiers:** Information used to map and look up existing call log information in the CRM.

### Authentication and Connectivity Data

The type of authentication information accessed and stored depends on the security protocol supported by the CRM:

* **OAuth Supported CRMs:** For CRMs supporting modern OAuth protocols, we are **not required** to store actual user credentials (e.g., username/password), as the design uses secure tokens.
* **Legacy CRMs:** Other CRMs may require us to store necessary credentials such as:
    * Username/password combinations.
    * API keys.
    * Other proprietary credentials.

### Support and Session Reports

* **Support Sessions:** With the explicit consent of a user, we may store session information to assist in the resolution of a specific support issue.
    * **Data Sensitivity:** These reports can contain **PII** and other sensitive data required to diagnose the problem.
    * **Retention Policy:** These session reports are automatically and permanently deleted after **30 days**.
