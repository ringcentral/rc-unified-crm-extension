# findContact (by Phone)

This interface is central to App Connect's framework as it is responsible for matching phone numbers with contacts in the target CRM. This interface powers the following key features:

* call pop
* call logging
* sms logging

This interface can return zero, one or more contacts. If multiple contacts are returned, App Connect will prompt the end user to select the specific contact to be used when logging calls. 

If no contact is found, do not create a contact in its place. When logging calls, if no contacts are found associated with a phone number, then the framework to prompt the user to create a contact. The user will enter a name, and then call the [createContact](createContact.md) interface, and then call the [createCallLog](createCallLog.md) with the newly created contact ID. 

This interface is called in the following circumstances:

* When a call is received.
* When a user manually clicks the "refresh contact" action for a contact or phone call. 
* When a user accesses App Connect the first time in an attempt to perform an initial contact match operation for recent phone calls.

## Request parameters

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user`             | An object describing the Chrome extension user associated with the action that triggered this interface. |
| `authHeader`       | The HTTP Authorization header to be transmitted with the API request to the target CRM.                  |
| `phoneNumber`      | The phone number to search for within the target CRM, provided in an E.164 format, e.g. +11231231234.    |
| `overridingFormat` | (Optional) If defined by the user under advanced settings, this will contain alternative formats the user may wish to use when searching for the `phoneNumber` |

!!! warning "Alternative formats"
    Some CRM's have very restrictive APIs with regards to searching for phone numbers, meaning they require an *exact match* in order to find a contact with that phone number. To work around this restriction, users are allowed to specify a [list of phone number formats](../../users/phone-number-formats.md) which they often use when entering phone numbers into the CRM. It is the intention that each connector when provided a list of `overridingFormat` values to convert the E.164 phone number into each of the overriding formats, and to search for each one until a contact is found.
	
	*Remember: only a single call the* `getContact` *interface will be made. The developer is responsible for searching for each alternative format.*

## Return value(s)

This interface returns a single object. That object describes the contacts that were found. It has following properties:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`matchedContactInfo`| An array of objects containing `id`, `name` and optionally `additionalInfo` and `isNewContact`.|
|`returnMessage`|`message`, `messageType` and `ttl`|

!!! tip "isNewContact is only used as an extra option in contact list for users to be able to create new contacts"

### Returning contact specific information

In some circumstances when a call is being logged you need to collect contact or account specific information from the agent logging the call. Consider for a moment a use case you can see implemented in our Clio connector in which you want to link or associate a phone call with a specific legal matter. You don't know the list of possible matters until you have successfully matched the phone call with a contact. Then you want to present the agent with a easy-to-use pull-down menu showing the list of matters associated with the contact. 

To do this you need to do two things. First, in your manifest, you want to define the field you want to collect from the agent. On this field you will be sure to set `contactDependent` to `true`. 

```js hl_lines="8"
"page": {
    "callLog": {
        "additionalFields": [
            {
                "const": "matters",
                "title": "Matter",
                "type": "selection",
                "contactDependent": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Then in your connector, when you return your list of contacts, for each contact you will return the `additionalInfo` property in which you provide the list of matters. 

```js hl_lines="2"
[{ 
    "const": m.matter.id, 
	"title": m.matter.display_number, 
	"description": m.matter.description, 
	"status": m.matter.status 
}]
```

The values returns are bound to the field via correlating the two `const` values found in the additional field and the contact record. 

### Example response

```js
{
  matchedContactInfo:[
    {
      id: 'contact id',
      name: 'John Doe',
      additionalInfo: null,
      isNewContact: false
    },
    {
        id: 'createNewContact',
        name: 'Create new contact...',
        additionalInfo: null,
        isNewContact: true
    }
  ],
  returnMessage:{
    message: 'Found 1 contact',
    messageType: 'warning', // 'success', 'warning' or 'danger'
    ttl: 30000 // in miliseconds
  }
}
```
