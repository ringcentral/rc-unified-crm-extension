# findContactWithName

It is not uncommon that when logging a call, a contact cannot be found using the [findContact](findContact.md) interface which attempts to lookup a contact into the target CRM via a phone number. Sometimes however, a contact cannot be found, but is in fact known to be in the CRM. This is when this interface comes into play.

When a contact cannot be found, users are given the option to search the CRM for a contact by name. This allows users to associate calls with contacts in a more manual fashion when a contact is not found via a phone number. 

This interface is called to facilitate that search process.
