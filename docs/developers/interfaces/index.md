# App Connect connector interfaces

Each connector exposes an API that the App Connect server connects and exchanges data with. Each endpoint or interface of this API corresponds to a function supported by App Connect, and is responsible for fulfilling that function within the context of the CRM being connected to. 

Every App Connect connector needs to implement each of the following interfaces.
