# Solution: AI-Generated Insights

<div class="solution-header" markdown>

### Turn Every Conversation Into a Strategic Asset

Most communication data is "dark data"—it disappears the moment the call ends. App Connect 2.0 uses RingCentral’s native AI to illuminate these conversations, automatically extracting meaning, sentiment, and action items so your team can move faster and smarter.

## Beyond Transcription

While others just provide text, App Connect provides context. Our AI doesn't just record what was said; it understands what happened and what needs to happen next.

### Core Capabilities

* **[AI Assistant (Beta)](../users/ai.md):** Access live, real-time transcription during your calls. Use the interactive interface to "tag" critical moments as they happen, creating an instant map of the conversation for post-call review.
* **[ACE (AI Conversation Expert)](../users/ace.md):** Leveraging advanced Large Language Models, ACE analyzes call transcripts to identify the "why" behind the call. It automatically detects customer intent, identifies objections, and highlights successful talk tracks.
    * **Automated Action Items:** The AI identifies commitments made during the call—such as "I'll send the contract by Friday"—and automatically suggests them as follow-up tasks in your CRM, ensuring no promise is ever forgotten. (Required ACE)
    * **Sentiment & Tone Analysis:** Get a visual breakdown of the caller’s emotional state throughout the conversation. Identify where a call turned from frustrated to satisfied, or pinpoint common friction points in your sales process. (Requires ACE)
* **Intelligent Call Summaries:** Replace manual note-taking with high-quality, bulleted summaries. These AI-generated notes provide a standardized overview of every call, making it easy for anyone on the team to get up to speed in seconds.
