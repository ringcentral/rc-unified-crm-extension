# Solution: Communication Logging & Data Integrity

<div class="solution-header" markdown>

### Never Miss a Detail. Never Manually Log a Call Again. 

Your CRM is only as valuable as the data inside it. When reps are forced to manually log every call, text, and note, data gets lost, errors creep in, and productivity stalls. **App Connect** automates the entire documentation process, ensuring that every interaction is captured with 100% accuracy, every time.

!!! tip "Log all calls across your company instantly"
    When using [server-side call logging](../users/server-side-logging.md) an admin can turn on automated logging for all their co-workers and employees without requiring them all to install App Connect.

## Your Single Source of Truth

Stop chasing "ghost calls" that aren't in the system. App Connect bridges the gap between your conversations and your records, creating a seamless audit trail that lives exactly where it should.

### Core Capabilities

* **[Automated Call Logging](../users/automatic-logging.md):** As soon as a call ends, App Connect creates a task or activity record in your CRM. Duration, direction, timestamp, and participant details are synced instantly.
* **[SMS & Fax Synchronization](../users/sms.md#logging-sms-conversations):** Communication isn't just voice. App Connect logs inbound and outbound text messages and faxes directly to the contact record.
* **[Multi-Match Intelligence](../users/automatic-logging.md#automatically-resolving-logging-conflicts):** When a phone number is associated with multiple contacts, App Connect intelligently prompts the user to select the correct record.
* **[Server-Side Logging](../users/server-side-logging.md):** Ensure nothing slips through the cracks. Calls are recorded in the CRM even if the browser is closed or the user is on a mobile device.

### Advanced: Auto-Logging Rules & Conflict Resolution

Large organizations often face "Logging Conflicts"—where a phone number matches multiple records or no record at all. App Connect 2.0 introduces **Unattended Conflict Resolution** to keep your data flowing without interrupting your reps.

* **Smart Auto-Matching:** Define rules to resolve conflicts automatically without user intervention.
    * **Last Modified:** Automatically log the call to the contact record that was most recently updated in your CRM.
    * **Alphabetical/Priority:** Assign logs based on specific record hierarchy.
* **Automatic Contact Creation:** If no match is found, App Connect can automatically create a placeholder contact (e.g., "New Lead - [Phone Number]") so the activity is captured and searchable immediately.
* **Unresolved Queue:** For conflicts that truly require a human touch, App Connect holds them in a dedicated "Unresolved" tab. Reps can batch-process these at the end of the day in seconds, rather than stopping after every call.

    "By implementing Unattended Conflict Resolution rules, we eliminated 90% of the manual logging prompts our team was seeing. Our CRM data is cleaner than ever, and our reps never have to stop dialing."
