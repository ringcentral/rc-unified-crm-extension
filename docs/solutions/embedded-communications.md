# Solution: Embedded Communications

<div class="solution-header" markdown>

### The "Toggle Tax" is Over. Work Where You Live.

Most sales and support professionals lose up to **20% of their day**[^1] switching between browser tabs and standalone communication apps. **App Connect** eliminates this friction by embedding the full power of RingCentral directly into your CRM or web-based application.

## One Interface. Zero Distractions.

Why leave your customer’s record to make a call? App Connect turns your browser into a high-performance communication hub, ensuring that your tools and your conversations exist in the same space.

!!! tip "App Connect works with ANY RingCentral device"
    Whether you use App Connect's embedded dialer, the RingCentral desktop app, the RingCentral mobile app, or even a desk phone, App Connect works with and logs calls to your connected system.

### **Core Capabilities**

* **The Persistent Dialer:** A sleek, floating browser extension (Chrome or Edge) that follows you across tabs. Access your dialer, messages, and call history without ever navigating away from your active lead.
* **[Instant Click-to-Dial](../users/making-calls.md#turning-onoff-click-to-dial):** Transform every phone number on any webpage into a clickable link. One click initiates the call through RingCentral instantly—no more manual dialing, no more typos.
* **[Intelligent Screen-Pop](../users/screen-pop.md):** Know who’s calling before you even pick up. App Connect automatically identifies incoming numbers and opens the matching CRM record instantly, giving you the context you need to be personal and effective.
* **[Unified Messaging](../users/sms.md):** Send and receive SMS/MMS directly within your workflow. Whether it’s a quick follow-up or a photo of a contract, stay connected via text without reaching for your phone.
* **Rich Call Controls:** Manage your calls with professional-grade features including mute, hold, transfer, and recording—all from the embedded interface.


!!! info "**Looking for High-Volume Outreach?**"
    While **Click-to-Dial** is perfect for real-time engagement, teams focused on aggressive outbound growth can use our **"Click-to-Dial Later"** feature. This allows you to queue up calls into a streamlined list for rapid-fire execution.
