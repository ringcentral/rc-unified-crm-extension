# Solution: The Universal Connector & Custom Integrations

<div class="solution-header" markdown>

### If It Has a URL, We Can Integrate With It.

The biggest challenge in communication technology is the "integration gap"—the specialized or proprietary software your company relies on that doesn't have a native plug-in. App Connect closes this gap with a developer-friendly framework that brings RingCentral to any web-based application in minutes.

## Your Framework for Total Connectivity

Stop waiting for third-party developers to build the integration you need. App Connect is built on a "Universal Connector" philosophy, providing the tools for IT teams and developers to embed communications into niche, home-grown, or proprietary CRMs with minimal code.

### Core Capabilities

* [Manifest Framework](../developers/manifest.md): Create a custom integration simply by defining a JSON manifest. Map CRM fields to the App Connect dialer to enable contact matching and data logging without complex API middleware.
* [Proxy Connector](../developers/proxy-connector.md): Use our proxy architecture to bridge the gap between RingCentral and your internal databases. This allows for secure, real-time data exchange even with apps sitting behind your corporate firewall.
* [Connector SDK](../developers/getting-started.md): For deeper, more specialized workflows, our SDK allows you to customize the behavior of the extension. Trigger specific events in your web app based on call states (e.g., "On Call," "Call Ended").

## Why the Universal Connector Wins

| Feature | The Business Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Zero-Code Options | Non-developers can often set up basic integrations using only the manifest. |
| Rapid Deployment | Move from "no integration" to "full productivity" in hours, not months. |
| Future-Proof | As your internal tools evolve, simply update your manifest to keep the integration live. |
| Secure Architecture | Data stays within your ecosystem; the connector acts as the secure bridge. |
