# Customizing App Connect's appearance

App Connect provides several appearance customization options to help you personalize your experience. These settings allow you to control the visual interface, manage notification preferences, and customize the overall look and feel of the extension. You can access these settings from the General settings section. 

## Customizing navigation and tabs

The customize tabs feature allows you to personalize which tabs and sections are visible in your App Connect interface, helping you streamline your workflow by showing only the features you use most frequently. Customizing tabs can have the following benefits:

- **Simplified Interface**: Hide tabs you don't frequently use to reduce clutter
- **Faster Navigation**: Focus on the features most important to your workflow
- **Personalized Experience**: Tailor the interface to match your specific role and responsibilities

!!! tip "Recommended Setup"
    Start with all tabs enabled and gradually disable those you rarely use. You can always re-enable tabs later if your workflow changes.

## Managing in-app messages and notifications

Notification level settings help you control which types of notifications App Connect displays, allowing you to stay informed about important events while minimizing distractions from less critical alerts.
