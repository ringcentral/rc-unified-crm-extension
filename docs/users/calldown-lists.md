# Call-down Lists

<!-- md:version 2.0 -->

Call-down lists help you manage and execute outbound calling campaigns efficiently. This feature provides a centralized place to organize your contacts, make sequential calls, and track your calling progress—all designed to help you meet your outbound call quotas.

## What are Call-down Lists?

Call-down lists are personal contact lists that streamline your outbound calling workflow. Instead of manually searching for and dialing each contact, you can:

- **Create organized lists** of contacts you need to call
- **Schedule callbacks** for future engagement
- **Track your progress** toward daily call goals

## Accessing Call-down Lists

Find your call-down lists in the **Call-down** tab within App Connect.

## Adding Contacts to Your List

You can add contacts to your call-down list in several ways:

### From Click-to-Dial

Hover on contact number and use click-to-dial to schedule it.

### During Call Logging

After completing a call, you can schedule a callback by selecting the option to call this contact at a later time. This automatically adds them to your call-down list.
