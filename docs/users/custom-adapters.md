# Configuring your organization to use a custom connector

App Connect enables developers to build custom connectors to connect to proprietary CRMs, or CRMs not supported natively by App Connect. Users can load a custom connector under "Developer Settings." Admins however can manage this setting across their entire account under the "Custom connector" area of the Admin tab.
