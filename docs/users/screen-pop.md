# Screen-pop

Screen-pop, also known as "call-pop," refers to the feature in which App Connect will automatically open a user's browser to a contact you are calling or from whom you are receiving a call. This feature helps agents know exactly who they are speaking to before or during a call.

One will find call-pop settings under the "Call-pop" settings area that control under what circumstances App Connect will automatically open your CRM to the contact or person being called, or calling you.
