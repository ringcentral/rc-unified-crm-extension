A lookup can fail in some CRMs:</p> <ol> <li>If the phone number stored in the CRM does not EXACTLY match the phone number as seen in App Connect. This is due to limitations in the connected CRMs' APIs. </li> <li>If you have just created it and the CRM server usually doesn't reflect the change immediately. Some CRMs have refresh clock to update all changes every X seconds/minutes. So if it's just created and can be seen on CRM webpages, please wait for a couple of minutes and it should then be fetched to the extension.</li> </ol> <p>There are two ways to fix the issue:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Update the contact record's phone number so that it conforms to the E.164 standard. This will be the most reliable solution and the most performant. However, reformatting the phone numbers across a huge contact database may not be feasible or practical. </p> </li> <li> <p>Update the advanced configuration settings of App Connect to add the phone number formats commonly used by your company.
